# lncRNAs_in_b_cell_development_and_activation


This repository contains code used to produce figures and tables presented in my 2016 
publication ['Long noncoding RNAs in B-cell development and activation'](https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2015-11-680843).

Initial sequence data processing was done using [CGAT Pipelines](https://github.com/CGATOxford/CGATPipelines). Specifically:
i) mapping RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data was done with pipeline_mapping.py, ii) transcript assembly was done with pipeline_rnaseqtranscripts.py, iii) initial lncRNA detection was done with pipeline_rnaseqlncrna.py, and iv) irreprpducibility discovery rate (IDR) analysis was done with pipeline_idr.py.
